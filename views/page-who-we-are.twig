        <p class="md:text-lg mb-4">GWS Tool Group is a North American company that specializes in making custom, standard, and modified standard cutting tools. While we have the resources and capabilities of large companies in our industry, we maintain a small and service-focused approach.</p>
        <p class="md:text-lg mb-4">We've achieved this by consistently investing in our organization and acquiring leading specialty manufacturers. These acquired companies, like GW Schultz Tool, CGI Tool, and others, now work together under the GWS Tool Group umbrella, combining their expertise to serve our customers effectively.</p>
        <p class="md:text-lg mb-4">Our "Custom Comes Standard" philosophy reflects how we provide value to the market. We're known for being a one-stop shop for customized tooling needs, designing and manufacturing these tools in our various factories. What sets us apart is our ability to tailor our capacity to meet the unique requirements of our customers and their preferred partners. We encourage everyone to think creatively because with GWS, the possibilities are virtually limitless.</p>
